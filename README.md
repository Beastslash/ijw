### Roblox Creator Store
IJW is available on the [Roblox Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/95109341366676). If it gets outdated, raise an issue. In the future, we want to automate the publishing process. 

## Examples
Check out some of the tests in the [source](./src). Test files are suffixed with ".test.luau", but you're not required to add that to your own files. Do whatever you want â€” it just works.
